## Dev info

I started working on this on 2018-11-02 but ran into issues with the font:

it's one pixel shorter than the original! 

I gave up trying to fix this and accepted that'll it'll be wrong.

The other big issue is that it has heart-based letters for some letters and 
I wanted to expose both of these to the user. I tried some different options
but it seems that putting them in as uppercase variants is the least terrible.

At some point I need to add the ability to have a little "help" panel that explains
these things, so you can read how to use it.
